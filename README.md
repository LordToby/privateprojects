# privateprojects
A collection of various software programs I've made, during education or in private
Many code comments and files are written in Danish


BankAppSwift: A small app written in Swift connected to Google Firebase where you create a bank account and deposit and withdraw money from these accounts.
NOTE: Does only work on Mac computers


danskApp: A small website made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS, where you have to remember the written sentences and try to write the sentence as closesly as they were written in order to get a point

testAPI: Small C  program making API calls to a localhost connection. 
NOTE. The whole project could not be uploaded, as the file was too big. Therefore the code is only for inspiration

Bibliotekssystem: A small WPF applicitaion written in C# and connected to a MS-SQL database through entity framework. It simulates a library, where you can borrow or turn in borrowed books
